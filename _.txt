 Justify your recommendations.

->Predicting the food delivery time.
->Predicting weather the transaction fraudulent.
->Predicting the credit limit of a credit card application.
->Predicting Natural Disaster.


Answer=>

1. Predicting the Food Delivery Time
Recommended Algorithm: Regression Algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor)

Justification:

->Nature of the Problem: This is a regression problem because the target variable (delivery time) is continuous.
->Feature Types: Likely features include distance, traffic conditions, restaurant preparation time, delivery person availability, etc.
->Linear Regression: Useful if the relationship between features and delivery time is approximately linear.
